## About

reX9 is a public transport routing software based on time, locations, interests,
and heuristics, with a strong aim for providing a [DWIM]-like interface.


## Details

It obtains rough user constraints like time ranges, an optional travel destination
and further stops on the trip, and computes travel plan drafts using the [HAFAS] API.


## Setup

Install the most recent version of reX9.
```shell
pip install --upgrade 'git+https://github.com/panodata/rex9'
```


## Usage

```shell
rex9 travel --from=Oranienburg --to=Stralsund --stops=FÃ¼rstenberg,Mildenberg --when=do-di
```

The `--when` argument accepts all date-/time-range expressions as provided by the [Aika]
package, which currently supports English and German.
